====FINAL PROJECT====

For my project I made a simulation that emulates the evolution of a simple organism on a graphic user interface using Python. For the GUI I used the Pygame module which may be needed to run the source code.

====FILES AND DESCRIPTIONS====

1) evolution3.py is the code for the simulation.

2) Notes&Information(SLS12).docx is the write-up.
 
3) Scenario1.mp4 is a video of one outcome of the simulation. I mention this in the write-up. The video blinks a lot because the simulation takes a while to render, and I could only screen record at a low FPS speed. Hopefully the general idea is still clear though.

4) Scenario2.mp4 is a video of another outcome of the simulation. I mention this in the write-up.
